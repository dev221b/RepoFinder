# GitHub Repo Finder
# Team Name: wHackers
# Our idea:
When I come across a cool website, I get this immense curiosity to know how it was built. So, 
we go to GitHub, which is the most used code sharing platform, and type in the name of the 
website in the search box. Sometimes, it will be easy to find the right repository. Often, scrolling 
down to find the right repo is a tedious task. Our GitHub Repo Finder is a Chrome extension that 
will search GitHub for you and find the right repo link (if available) for the website you are 
currently visiting.
# Empowering Productivity:
GitHub Repo Finder will save time that would otherwise be wasted in searching through 
different repositories on GitHub. You donâ€™t even have to open GitHub. The extension will do the 
work for you. The code containing repo of the website you are visiting can be directly accessed 
from the same page. 
# Stacks & Tools:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON
# How it benefits people:
Curious minds can directly hop on to cloning the website or analyzing the code used to build the 
site. Even people who are not familiar with GitHub can use the extension to view the code and 
explore the repository, thereby gaining exposure to how GitHub works as well. The person who 
has open sourced the code will get more attention and the users can also comfortably contribute 
to making the site better when they get the link to the repo this easily without having to search 
GitHub for it.
# User Journey Map:
A user simply has to add the extension to their chrome. When visiting a website, they can open 
the extension from the toolbar and click the find button. The most related public GitHub repo 
link for the website is displayed.
